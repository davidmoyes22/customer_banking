# customer_banking
You'll be creating a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.
## Code Considerations
* On lines 21-23 within the customer_banking.py file, a tutor recommended that I use three different print functions instead of trying to print all of that information within one print function.
* On lines 21 and 25 within the savings_account.py file, a tutor recommended renaming those variables names to names other than "balance" and "interest".
* The tutor recommended that I remove "get functions" that I had added to that file and recommended that I return the new variables I created instead of trying to access the newly set balance and interest through those "get functions".
